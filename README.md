# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to prepare for the "silver tsunami" by the determining the amount of retirees based on title and comparing the results to the amount of mentors available to groom the next generation

### Results

##### Retiring Team Members by Title
![Retiring_Titles](https://github.com/jdfiel/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis./blob/main/retiring_titles.png)


- The two largest groups of retirees will be senior team members: Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, respectively

- Only 2 Managers are retiring

##### Eligible Mentors by Title
![Mentor_Titles](https://github.com/jdfiel/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis./blob/main/mentor_titles.png)

- The amount of Senior team members that are eligible for mentorship is incredibly small, relative to the amount of retirees

- Neither of the retiring Managers are eligible for mentorship

### Summary

#### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

In total, 90,398 team members will be retiring. When directly compared to the remaining 300,024 team members (as per the **Non-Retirees** table), this is a significant number of team members, comprising almost 25% of the total workforce. ~30 thousand of retiring team members will be members of Senior staff, meaning a significant loss of leadership will be occurring.

##### Non-Retirees

#### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

##### Non-Retirees by Title

Directly comparing the eligible mentors to the remaining team members may be alarming at first, especially when considering that just under half of the Senior Engineers will be retiring. That said, it is important to also recognize that amongst the remaining team members, Engineers comprise the largest portion of non-retirees. This means that there is a lot of potential for internal promotions to bolster Senior staff with team members that may require little-to-no mentorship due to their existing experience and familiarity with the company. Not only does this mean that many of the open positions can be quickly fulfilled internally (reducing total onboarding workloads), but mentors  could therefore, in theory, focus their attention on new staff that would be hired for openings that can't be filled internally.

Further, the number of Managers retiring is only 2, a fraction of the remaining 22. Based on the number of Managers within the company, they should rank above Senior Engineers and Senior Staff (though it would be best to confirm this). As such, the bulk of leadership will be largely unaffected. Thus, while the number of retirement-ready employees in the departments able to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees may look to be insufficient, as long as existing team members were properly trained, many of the next generation can take on entry-level roles, reducing the strain and importance of on-boarding training significantly.
